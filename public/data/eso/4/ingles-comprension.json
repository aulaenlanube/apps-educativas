It was a period of scientific and technological development that transformed rural societies into urban and industrial ones. The key invention was the STEAM ENGINE, which powered factories and trains. While it brought economic growth, it also caused problems like child labor and pollution. Thousands of people moved from the countryside to cities, looking for work in the new 'dark satanic mills'. This period changed the way we live and work forever.",
