Today, private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are developing technology to take tourists into space. In the future, scientists hope to build a human colony on Mars. This will be a huge challenge because Mars has a thin atmosphere and no liquid water on the surface. We will need to invent new ways to grow food and produce oxygen. Many people believe that space travel is the only way to save humanity if Earth becomes uninhabitable.",

Legend says that St. Patrick used the shamrock to explain the Holy Trinity and that green makes you invisible to leprechauns.
