Apps like TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat allow them to share videos and photos with their friends. However, some experts are worried. They say that teens spend too much time on their screens and not enough time sleeping or doing exercise. A recent study says that students who use their phones late at night often have worse grades at school. It is important to find a balance between technology and real life.",
